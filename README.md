[![GitHub license](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-blue.svg)](LICENSE.md)

`mqtt2tivoremote` is a Node.js application that links TiVo DVRs to an MQTT broker. It is designed to be used to integrate these devices into a home automation system à la [mqtt-smarthome](http://www.github.com/mqtt-smarthome/mqtt-smarthome/).

## Getting Started

`mqtt2tivoremote` is distributed through NPM:

```sh
npm install -g mqtt2tivoremote

# or, if you prefer:
yarn global add mqtt2tivoremote
```

Running it is likewise easy:

```sh
mqtt2tivoremote                      # if your MQTT broker is running on localhost
mqtt2tivoremote -b mqtt://<hostname> # if your broker is running elsewhere
haiku2mqtt --help                    # to see the full usage documentation
```

## Topics and Payloads

This app is intended to conform to the [mqtt-smarthome](http://www.github.com/mqtt-smarthome/mqtt-smarthome/) architecture.  The topics used by the app are generally of the form:

### Topics Published

| Topic                            | Purpose                                                                          |
|----------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `tivoremote/connected`           | 0 = not connected to anything<br>1 = connected to MQTT but not DVR<br>2 = connected to both.
| `tivoremote/status/channel`      | JSON encoded current channel information<br>schema: `{ channel: num, subchannel: num, reason: string }`
| `tivoremote/status/livetv_ready` | When a teleport to Live TV is attempted, this will be set to false.<br>When LiveTV is being displayed, this will change to true.
| `tivoremote/status/error         | A string containing information about the most recent error to occur.

### Topics Subscribed
For performance reasons, no argument checking is done: if you pass in an invalid IR code, for instance, it will still get sent to the DVR.

| Topic                            | Purpose                                                                          |
|----------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `tivoremote/set/ircode`          | Set to one of the valid IR codes to send that command to the DVR.  No acknowledgement or confirmation will be returned.
| `tivoremote/set/keyboard`        | As above, but for keboard commands rather than IR codes.
| `tivoremote/set/teleport`        | Set to one of TIVO, LIVETV, GUIDE, or NOWPLAYING to jump directly to that screen.  Minimal status is available on `tivoremote/status/teleport`.
| `tivoremote/set/channel`         | Set the DVR to the given channel unless a recording is in progress.  Only works if the DVR is in Live TV mode. Status will be reported on tivoremote/status/channel.  Message format: `{ "channel": num, "subchannel": num }` 
| `tivoremote/set/forcedChannel`   | As above, but will cancel an in-progress recording if necessary

cd mqtt2tivoremote
yarn
```

And the development workflow is likewise straightforward:
```sh
# make a change to the src/ file, then...
yarn build
